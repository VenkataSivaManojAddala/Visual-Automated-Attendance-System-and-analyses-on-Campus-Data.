ANALYSES ON UNIVERSITY DATA AND AUTOMATED ATTENDANCE SYSTEM :

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


This project can be looked at in 2 different parts, the first is the analyses and the second is the Automated attendance.

1. All the analayses can be found and executed in the "cms.scala" file inside the "Source Code" folder. Just uncommenting the function names in the main function will do.

2. For the automated attendance, the "auto_attend.scala" file should be used. The scala class first calls a python file (automated_attendance.py), executes it. Once the execution of the python file is completed (On pressing "Esc" key on the keyboard, when the camera window is open, will end the python program execution), a .csv file with the attendance of the day is stored in the specified path. The scala class reads the same file generated by the python script and updates the attendance in the respective class's table present in MySQL. The updation of the attendance happens automatically, without any human intervention.

3. The python script (automated_attendance.py), when executed opens a camera window. It uses the face_recognition and cv2 modules to recognize the faces of students. The addition of one image per student in the people dictionary in the code, will make the model recognize a student whose image is present in the dictionary. Since this is a base model, the recognition model can not be too precise, which makes it predict wrong sometimes. That is why the attendance for a person will only be marked when a user finds the detection correct and presses "Enter".

4. Since there is no addition of student images, the model can recognize the persons whose images are there in the folder "train" inside the "Dataset" folder.

5. All the code files are in the "Source Code" folder.

6. All the data required is inside the "Dataset" folder.

7. For visualising the results, we made use of Jupiter Notebook. The "Visualisation.ipynb" file contains the code for plotting all the result data.

8. Without having "HADOOP HOME" as a home directory in your system, the functions for visualisation, "deptwant()", "distreasons()", "poorintot()", "subvsatt()"  in "cms.scala" will throw an error. In that case, kindly use the existing .csv files inside the "Results" folder.


**** NOTE :
 
-> The tables in MySQL are stored in a local system, thus creation of tables before running any files is required. Kindly use the "cms.sql" and "ATTENDANCE.sql" files to create necessary tables in your local system. 

-> Every program file (.scala, .sql and .py) loads data based on the directory. Therefore make sure to download all the files present in the "Dataset" folder and change the path of datasets in all the codes to the directory where you have them.

-> The .pdf file is attached for easier understanding of the project objective, results and conclusion.

**** Since the usage of different packages and libraries has been done, please make sure to add the dependencies from the "build.sbt" file in the "Source Code" folder.
